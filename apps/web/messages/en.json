The concept goes beyond a traditional online store — the system integrates social networking features, allowing each artisan to publish their products and also share their personal story. Through this, visitors to the platform not only discover unique handmade items, but also learn about the context, journey, and inspirations behind each piece. The platform fosters a connection between the public and the artists, encouraging conscious consumption and cultural recognition.",
